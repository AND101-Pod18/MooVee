## App Overview

### Description

This app recommends a random movie to watch.

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Highly visual experience with movie posters, trailers, and touch-based interactions. More engaging on mobile than a simple website, especially if paired with personalization or swipe-based UI (e.g. like/dislike system).
- **Story:** Very relatable. Everyone has wanted help picking a movie. It’s easy to pitch to friends, and the value is clear—solving choice fatigue. Strong "daily life companion" vibe.
- **Market:** Movie fans or people looking for something to watch will use this app.
- **Habit:** Users can use this app whenever they want entertainment.
- **Scope:** Not too technically challenging
