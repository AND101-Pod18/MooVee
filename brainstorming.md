## Evaluation of top 3 Ideas
1. movie recs
    - Mobile: Highly visual experience with movie posters, trailers, and touch-based interactions. More engaging on mobile than a simple website, especially if paired with personalization or swipe-based UI (e.g. like/dislike system).
    - Story: Very relatable. Everyone has wanted help picking a movie. It‚Äôs easy to pitch to friends, and the value is clear‚Äîsolving choice fatigue. Strong "daily life companion" vibe.
    - Market: Movie fans or people looking for something to watch will use this app.
    - Habit: Users can use this app whenever they want entertainment.
    - Scope: Not technically challenging

2. motivational app
    - Mobile: on the go, you always have your phone on you compared to a computer
    - Story: its a simple app with a good intention, i think the value can be seen pretty straightforward
    - Market: large market bc it's open to all
    - Habit: daily usage bc user can see a new motivational quote every day, can become part of their daily routine
    - Scope: can be completed by deadline, not too complex

3. random story/letter/word
    - Mobile: Its a fun random app that isn't too serious, which makes it great to pull up on the go when you have some free time.
    - Story: Great for humor and creativity. Could become popular among teens, writers, or as a game at parties. Value is in fun and creativity, not productivity. Very sharable.
    - Market: Creative writing fans, students, or meme lovers might love it. Not everyone will download a ‚Äúrandom letter app,‚Äù but for the right audience it could go viral.
    - Habit: Low habit potential unless it‚Äôs made gamified or social. Could be used weekly for fun, but not likely to be a daily go-to.
    - Scope: I think it feasable, however there are new concepts we would have to think of. Namely hiding words and displaying them and keeping it engaging and interesting. It is pretty defined idea.
